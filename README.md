  My notification bot
@BotFather
    Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.

@BotFather
    Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/csaludnotificacionesbot.

By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.
